## What is gRPC?
gRPC stands for **Google — Remote Procedure Call**, 
and it is a framework for communication utilizing **Protocol Buffers**.
While there is a lot of technical details as to what a Remote Procedure Call is, 
it allows a program on one machine (your Android phone) to call a subroutine on another machine (a server) without knowing that it is remote.

### What is protocol?
Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a free and open-source cross-platform data format used to serialize structured data. 
It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a network or for storing data.
Protocol Buffers are smaller, faster, and simpler while providing higher performance than other standards such as XML and JSON.
